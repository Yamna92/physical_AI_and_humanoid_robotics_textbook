# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This comprehensive guide will take you through the fascinating world of embodied intelligence—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws.

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You'll learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Quarter Modules

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Focus**: Middleware for robot control
- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Focus**: Physics simulation and environment building
- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- **Focus**: Advanced perception and training
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation
- Nav2: Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
